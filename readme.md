Eshop controller shows product based on id in url. Look into cache for product, if not found it looks into database and cache it for next time. Then it increase number of request on current product and return Json data.

## How it works

Id of product is checked if it is saved in cache if yes, then product is returned in Json. If not it is randomly generated by fake database, saved to cache for later use and returned in Json. With every access to data, number of searches of every id is saved into file. Cache is in `files/cacheData.txt`. Marketing data is in `files/marketingData.txt`.

## How to run Eshop controller

1. Install `Docker`.
2. Run `make build-image` in cmd.
3. Run `make run-container`.
4. Open browser with url `localhost:3000/api/product?id=1`.

## Switch between ElasticSearch and MySql

1. Open `ProductService.php`.
2. Find method `getProduct($id, false)` on class `DatabaseService`.
3. Change false on method `getProduct($id, false)` to true to switch on MySql.
